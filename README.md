Use these questions to guide your thinking:

What do you see happening?
What is your hypothesis for the cause of the problem? (this will be broadly based on intuition initially)
What is the impact of the problem on stakeholders?
What is the impact of the problem not being solved?

Answering these questions will help you define a problem you are trying to solve and will allow you to find the right data to solve it.
Once you have defined a problem, clean the data as necessary, and use your Data Analysis skills to explore the data set and derive insights.

Make sure to use 5 Whys Analysis in your analysis and use this to create a report which conveys a data story.

Once you have framed the problem and gathered initial insights from the data, you can ask the following questions as you dig deeper into your analysis.

What do you see happening?
What are the specific symptoms of the problem?
What is your hypothesis for the cause of the problem?
Five 'Whys' approach

Once you have the problem better defined, you can use 5 Whys technique to determine its root cause by repeatedly asking the question “Why”.

It's also called the Root Cause Analysis, developed by Sakichi Toyoda, founder of Toyota Industries. Here’s an example of how this technique could be used to figure out the cause of the following problem: A business went over budget on a recent project.

Q: “Why did we go over budget on our project?”

A: It took much longer than we expected to complete.

Q: “Why did it take longer than expected to complete?”

A: We had to redesign several elements of the product.

Q: “Why did we have to redesign elements of the product?”

A: Features of the product were confusing to use.

Q: “Why were the features of the product confusing to use?”

A: We made incorrect assumptions about what users wanted.

Q: “Why did we make incorrect assumptions about what users wanted?”

A: Our user experience research team didn’t ask effective questions.

As you see above, what looked like a budgeting problem turned out to be a problem with the user experience team not working effectively.
